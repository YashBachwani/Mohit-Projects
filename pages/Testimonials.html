      <div class="text">&quot; Many people don't talk about this subject with as much detail.<br>
        People talk very superficially but Mohit went into much of the details<br>Mohit gave us step by step
        guidelines on how to better our communication.<br> I found this session very thought provoking
        and valuable, I'm going to <br> work upon all these steps. The session was a 10 on 10.&quot;<br>

      <div class="text">&quot; For any of you reading this you should definitely definitely attend <br>
        Mohit's masterclass, solely because Mohit is not just going to tell you <br> that 'you need
        to speak this way or that way'. He's going to talk about the<br> finest of details, and he'll
        make you relaize that communication is not <br>just about speaking.It's
        about your body language, it's about your <br>voice modulation, it's about a
        lot of things. &quot;<br>

      <div class="text">&quot; Mohit's masterclass connected with me on many points which I found very <br>
        interesting. The point Mohit mentioned where when you are question someone <br>
        you're in an authoritative position, that was something very new to me.<br>
        Mohit exceeded my expectations.Before attending his masterclass, I thought <br>
        this was just some random guy organizing a random workshop, <br>
        but now after personally attending Mohit's masterclass, it has been great.<br>
        Mohit is very much qualified to organize masterclass on communication<br>
        and people must attend them&quot;<br>

      <div class="text">&quot; For the last 20 years, I&lsquo;ve been trying to become a public speaker. I've tried
        hundreds of courses,<br> read their study material, mugged up everything, but on the
        stage, I could not speak. This became the biggest <br>fear of my life.
        I&lsquo;ve succeeded in my career and work as a CA, but whenever I got an opportunity
        to speak in front of an audience,<br> I just couldn&lsquo;t.
        Barely a month ago(16th May, 2024), I met Mohit and I took his sessions, and from
        day 1, we got to work. <br>We did an activity wherein he made me act out a particular
        scene from a movie. After that activity, <br>I felt like I could speak well and from then
        most of my fear vanished. Post that he made me speak<br> everyday and taught me
        many tools and techniques which were
        magical for me and using those techniques, <br>I
        gave my first ice breaker speech in
        toastmaster and I was the best speaker of that
        meeting.
        <br><br>
        I am very thankful to Mohit for making me a
        public speaker. <br>Now, I can go in front of the
        stage and speak in front of anyone.”<br>

      <div class="text"> “4 years ago, I moved to India, to pursue my further education to become
        a doctor.<br>During these 4 years, I focused purely on becoming a doctor and I started to lose
        sight of <br>who I really am, in addition to that i got diagnosed with a disease (Reverse
        Argyll Robertson Pupil)<br> that caused me to become visually impaired, which made
        me lose sight of my whole career because <br>I was told I can’t practice medicine or
        surgery, which caused a lot of confusion for me because now I <br>didn&lsquo;t know what I
        can pursue as a career and I felt stuck, for the very first time in my life I didn’t<br>
        know what to do, I couldn&lsquo;t sleep, I felt like what I wanted to communicate wasn&lsquo;t
        being heard, I was depressed,<br> on various medications including antidepressants.
        Then I met Mohit, and together we worked upon finding my strengths,<br> my values
        and decided on a career path that was more suitable based on my strengths,
        limitations and what I can do best.<br>
        After working with Mohit I can proudly say that I am good at communicating now
        and even a better public speaker.<br>
        I eat better and live a healthier lifestyle and I can finally
        sleep peacefully, more than anything and I am finally happy,<br>
        All thanks to Mohit.
        In life there will be highs and lows,
        don&lsquo;t be afraid to ask for help
        and never give up.”<br>
